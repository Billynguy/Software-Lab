## Database Code

Make sure you have Python 3 installed.

After cloning this repo, you will need to set up a virtual environment and install the required Python packages for the back-end:

```sh
cd backend
py -3 -m venv venv # For Windows, or `python3 -m venv venv` on non-Windows systems
venv/Scripts/activate # For Windows, or `source venv/bin/activate` on non-Windows systems
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

After preparing the requirements, make sure you activate the virtual environment. Then, you can use the database code:

```sh
venv/Scripts/activate # For Windows, or `source venv/bin/activate` on non-Windows systems
# Do something with the database
```
